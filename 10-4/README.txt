* Solution to the following problem from the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book, 6th edition
* 10.4 Sorted Search, No Size: You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size
* method. It does, however, have an elementAt (i) method that returns the element at index i in
* O(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data
* structure only supports positive integers.) Given a Li sty which contains sorted, positive integers,
* find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.
